# Convex Backend

This directory contains the Convex functions and schema for the Ancestry Family Tree app.

## Key Files

- `schema.ts`: Database schema and validators.
- `*_generated/`: Autogenerated Convex bindings (do not edit).
- `lib/`: Shared helpers for Convex functions.
- `*.ts`: Query/mutation/action modules organized by domain.

## Development

From the repository root:

```bash
npm run dev:backend
```

Or run Convex directly:

```bash
npx convex dev
```

This prints the local deployment URL. Copy it into `.env.local` as `VITE_CONVEX_URL` if it is not set yet.

## Environment Variables

Store server-side secrets (for example, `OPENAI_API_KEY`) in the Convex dashboard or with `npx convex env set`.
